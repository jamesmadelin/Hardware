### Cryptosteel Security - Glitter polish and Burial 

Ideally you should bury your Cryptosteel on land owned by your family.  

The Cryptosteel also features a hole on which a padlock can be attached to prevent unauthorised access.

If you would like to make your Cryptosteel tamper evident we suggest using a cable tie in conjunction with a padlock and to paint the cable tie with a glitter nail polish and to then take a high resolution photo you are able to use for visual comparison.  

If you are unable to bury your Cryptosteel you are able to hide it inside a wall, under a floor.
