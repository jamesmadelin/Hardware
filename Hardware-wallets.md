## Hardware Wallets

Trezor and Ledger are both Hierarchical Deterministic (HD) Wallets that employ mnemonic seeds. They are also interoperable. Other hardware wallets are available.   

Hardware wallets generate and store keys and are used to sign transactions.  They can be safely used in conjunction with HOT wallets as the private keys are never exposed by the hardware wallet device. 

Hardware wallets are backed up using a wordlist seed and are the most cost effective way to securely manage bitcoins.

Both the Trezor and Ledger will generate a new wordlist seed when initialised, meaning you are able to use any computer for setup.

Trezor and Ledger also double as as a Universal Second Factor (U2F) Second Factor Authentication (2FA) security keys and can be used to protect your Facebook, Google and Dropbox accounts. 

Hardware wallets are immune to computer viruses that steal from software wallets, but are not immune to malware that could manipulate addresses in the memory of the computer you are currently using, this is why we suggest you always check the first and last four characters of an address before signing and broadcasting a transaction to send bitcoins, and to use as secure a computer as is possible, e.g. TAILS for desktop use and an unrooted Android device for mobile use.

The Trezor and Ledger hardware wallets can be used with a selected number of ALT coins.  

These specialist devices are highly recommended.  

If you plan on using bitcoin we urge you to get a hardware wallet and ensure your seed is securely backed up.
