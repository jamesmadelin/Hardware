# Hardware

Bitcoin is trustware, it is a combination of both hardware and software.  Specialist hardware and software are both used, and the exact combination of hardware and software you choose to deploy will dictate what levels of security and privacy you will be able to achieve. 

Below we take you through the various types of hardware that are highly recommened to use when interacting with the Bitcoin network.

[Hardware Wallets](https://github.com/OSBitcoinInfo/Hardware/blob/master/Hardware-wallets.md), e.g. [Trezor](https://shop.trezor.io/?a=684afda09cbe) and [Ledger](https://www.ledgerwallet.com/r/b85c)

Bitcoin Fullnode - coming soon!

Bitcoin Miner - coming soon!

It may be necessary to work with seeds and or private keys.  If you find this is the case then we strongly suggest only doing so with either an air-gapped computer or one that has been booted in a secure manner.
