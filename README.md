# Hardware

Bitcoin is trustware, it is a combination of both hardware and software.  Specialist hardware is used to both secure keys and to mine bitcoins.  Specialist software is also used to speak to the network such as fullnodes and wallets.  The exact combination of hardware and software you choose to deploy will dictate what levels of security and privacy you will be able to achieve. 


Below we take you through the various types of hardware that are highly recommened to use when interacting with the Bitcoin network.
