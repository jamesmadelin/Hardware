# Hardware

Bitcoin is trustware; it is a combination of both hardware and software.  Specialist hardware and software are both used, and the exact combination of hardware and software you choose to buy and deploy will dictate what levels of security and privacy you will be able to achieve.

You'll often find online that a hardware wallet is recommended for a 'significant holding'. This of course means different things to different people; is it $100 of currency? 0.5BTC? $5000? 10BTC? 

I recommend  you find a balance between 1/ how much is too much for you to risk losing and 2/ the cost of a hardware wallet as a percentage of your holding, compared to a usual fee to buy or sell shares, which can be about 1%. 

Using the second rule of thumb, a hardware wallet costing €70 is worth buying if you hold €5-7k of normal currency equivalents in crypto currency. If losing less than that would be too painful, refer to rule of thumb 1/ above and get a hardware wallet sooner!

Below we take you through the various types of hardware that are highly recommended to use when interacting with the Bitcoin network.

[Hardware Wallets](https://github.com/OSBitcoinInfo/Hardware/blob/master/Hardware-wallets.md), e.g. [Trezor](https://shop.trezor.io/?a=684afda09cbe) and [Ledger](https://www.ledgerwallet.com/r/b85c) are essential to safely handle coins on any device.

[Cryptosteel](https://github.com/OSBitcoinInfo/Hardware/blob/master/Cryptosteel.md) is the ultimate backup.

[Opendime](https://github.com/OSBitcoinInfo/Hardware/blob/master/Opendime.md) makes bitcoin physical on demand.

[Fullnode](https://github.com/OSBitcoinInfo/Hardware/blob/master/Fullnode.md) for both privacy and security.

It may be necessary to work with seeds and or private keys.  If you find this is the case then we strongly suggest only doing so with either an air-gapped computer or one that has been booted in a secure manner.

Bitcoin Mining is always a topic of interest.
