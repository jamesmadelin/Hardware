# Secure Boot

Computer security is very hard and if a machine is penetrated any data on it could be exfiltrated.  It is therefore imperative your private keys are not exposed to computers you do not trust.  Computers that are online are at high risk.  

Secure your bitcoins with a hardware wallet.  

You are advised to use a securely booted computer as described below when handling seeds and private keys.
